\chapter{Skills}

There are 21 skills in the Elder Scrolls Tabletop RPG. Each one comes with a specialization (combat, magic or stealth), a governing attribute (contributes to attribute increases when you level up), and a set of mastery perks you get automatically when you reach certain skill levels.

In addition to providing mastery perks, skill levels determine your proficiency with using the skill. Certain actions will require you to make a skill check. In order to do so, simply roll percentile and compare it to your skill value. If it is less than or equal to your skill, it is a success. If it is less than or equal to half your skill value, it is a hard success. If it is less than or equal to one-fifth of your skill value, it is an extreme success. If it is greater than your skill value, it is a failure.

Some checks may have a higher difficulty level and require a hard or extreme success to pass them. Some checks are contests, and the character with the higher success level wins. If you roll a 96 or higher, your roll is considered a "fumble," which is a lower success level than a failure. The GM has the option to impose a penalty for fumbles. If you are at least a Journeyman of that skill, you can only fumble on a 98 or higher.

Some skills may also provide some bonuses such as spell cost reduction based on skill level. Thus, it's worth boosting stats even if you don't get the next mastery perk. These bonuses will be covered in their respective chapters. In this chapter, you'll find a list of all the skills along with their specializations, governing attributes, meanings and mastery perks.
