\chapter{Equipment \& Combat Techniques}

Weapons and armor offer a variety of combat options to those skilled in their use. Each weapon and weapon type has certain properties that affect the manner in which it is used and the effects it has on targets. Players are encouraged to explore different choices of armament to see which tactics are effective in which situations. You may find that certain weapon types are more effective against certain enemies; it is therefore advantageous to train multiple combat skills and use the right weapons for the job.

In addition to these basic properties, equipment also grants access to combat techniques --- special moves you can do that deal extra damage and have bonus effects. Most techniques become available as your skill with weapons increases, as described in the skill mastery perk table (\textit{section 3.2}). Some techniques are available to everyone and may be used regardless of which weapons one is wielding. However, combat techniques cost stamina, so be sure to pace yourself!

\section{Glossary of Weapon Properties}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Blade: This is a bladed weapon, and it uses the Blade skill for attack rolls. All bladed weapons are Impaling.
	\item Blunt: This is a blunt weapon, and it uses the Blunt skill for attack rolls. Blunt weapons ignore some armor points.
	\item Heavy: This weapon is so large and/or heavy that it cannot be used more than once per round under any conditions.
	\item Impaling: This weapon has a sharp edge or point; on an extreme success, weapons with this property deal max damage and then another base damage die. (e.g. a longsword (1d10+DB) deals 10 damage in addition to the normal damage bonus and another d10 roll.)
	\item Light: This weapon is small and light enough that it can be used up to three times in a round. It is also excellent for dual wielding.
	\item One-Handed: This weapon only requires one hand to use.
	\item Magic: This weapon has magical properties which may make it interact with certain enemies in unusual ways.
	\item Marksman: This is a bow, and it uses the Marksman skill. All bows are Impaling.
	\item Medium: This weapon's weight is between that of a light and a heavy weapon, and it can be used twice per round.
	\item Reach: This weapon's length extends your reach by 5 ft.
	\item Two-Handed: This weapon requires the use of two hands and therefore prevents dual wielding, the use of shields, and possibly other tasks requiring hands (at the GM's discretion).
\end{itemize}

In addition to these properties, specific weapons also have a Quality, which can grant extra damage compared to poorer weapons of the same type. They have a base damage die as well, listed before the properties. Remember to add your skill and attribute damage bonuses as well. You get +1 to all melee attacks for every 25 points of Strength and +1 to all ranged attacks for every 25 points of Agility. Skills work the same way: every 25 points in a skill gives you a permanent +1 damage bonus for all weapons covered by that skill.

Note: whenever you see the abbreviation "DB," this refers to your damage bonus, which is the extra damage you gain via your attributes and skills. Extra damage granted by weapon quality is considered part of that weapon's base damage. Damage granted by enchantments or poisons is added after all multipliers are calculated and is not considered part of the damage bonus.

\section{Armors \& Shields}

Armor is quite simple in the ESTRPG. Rather than splitting armor up into various pieces and requiring the player to find them all, armors come in full suits. Each armor has an armor rating. whenever you take physical damage while wearing armor, subtract that armor's rating from the damage. Armor rating does not decrease from attacks unless something special damages the armor.

Armor comes in two varieties: heavy and light. Heavy armor generally provides better protection, but it imposes a penalty die on all non-social Stealth checks. All armor reduces movement speed, but heavy armor tends to reduce it more. Armor penalties can be mitigated by improving your armor skills. Shields are sold separately, but they provide additional armor and a bonus die on block rolls.

\section{Scrolls \& Staves}

Staves have stored spells in them which you can cast without spending magicka. Using one to attack works exactly the same way as using the spell stored in it (see \textit{Chapter 6}), only you do not need to know the spell or be of sufficient level to use it. When a staff runs out of charge, you cannot cast spells with it. It can be recharged by consuming a soul gem or by bringing it to a spell merchant and paying a fee.

Scrolls also allow you to cast stored magic without needing to know the spell, have the skill required to use it or spend any magicka. However, scrolls only allow you to cast a single spell before they are consumed and become completely useless.

\section{Improvised Weapons}
Sometimes, you may find yourself in a fight with no weapons on hand. Some objects may be used as improvised weapons and should be treated as a similar weapon type for the purposes of attacking. A chair leg might be defined as a mace, for example. The GM will decide what stats the item receives in this case. An object that does not resemble a weapon deals 1d6 damage.

\section{Silver Weapons}
You may come across certain creatures who are immune to normal weaponry. Such creatures may have be vulnerable to silver. You can pay a fee of 100 Septims to have a weapon silvered, giving it the Magic property.
