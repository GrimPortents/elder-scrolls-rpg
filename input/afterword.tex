\chapter*{Afterword}
This concludes the Elder Scrolls Tabletop Role Playing Game Player's Handbook. Once again, Elder Scrolls and all its titles and properties belong to Bethesda Game Studios. We have no intention of profiting from this game; it is entirely a fan work. We hope you enjoy our game and encourage you to support the Elder Scrolls franchise.\\

Special thanks to Alec for introducing me to LaTeX, with which I made this PDF. Thanks as well to everyone else for their interest in this project. I hope it turns out great! -Will
