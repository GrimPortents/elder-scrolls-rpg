\section{Classes}
There are a grand total of 21 classes in the Elder Scrolls Tabletop RPG, each with a unique combination of favored skills and attributes. You may wish to become more acquainted with what the skills mean in order to make an informed decision about which class you choose.\\

A class consists of 4 components:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A name.
	\item A specialization (combat, magic or stealth).
	\item Two favored primary attributes.
	\item Seven major skills.
\end{enumerate}

All skills grouped under the chosen specialization get a +5 bonus. The two favored attributes gain a +5 bonus as well. The seven major skills gain a +20 bonus; the remaining 14 skills are defined as minor skills. If you wish to create a custom class, simply choose the four components on your own. You should look over the 21 existing classes, however -- odds are you'll find multiple appealing choices.\\
