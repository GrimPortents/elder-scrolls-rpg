\chapter{Spellcasting}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{flamespell.png}
\end{figure}

Magic in the Elder Scrolls generally refers to the manipulation of magicka (magical energy) to alter the world in some way. Individual castings of this to achieve effects are known as spells. It can come from many sources, such as starlight, the Divines or Daedric Princes. All the races of Tamriel have some magical aptitude, though those of elvish blood are more naturally gifted.

There are many different forms of magic in Elder Scrolls and they have all been handled differently across the franchise. This game's magic system is based primarily on that from Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Player characters are able to draw on the magicka in their bodies to cast spells, which are governed by the schools of Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism and Restoration. Alchemy is also a magic skill in that it involves the manipulation of magical properties in alchemical reagents to create potions and poisons; it will be covered in the next chapter.

Spellcasting is somewhat similar to combat techniques in that it costs points, has the potential to give you greater damage and special effects, and gives you access to gradually more powerful abilities as your skills increase. However, it is different from techniques in that it uses your magicka instead of stamina; spells that deal damage also do not get attribute- or skill-based bonus damage. Spells have static values for their magnitude instead of rolls and so are often more reliable than weapon attacks. Also, increased skill in one of the magic schools reduces the cost of spells in that school, meaning you will have access to far more powerful spells as you level up.

\section{Spellcasting Formulas}

For convenience, here are the max magicka, magicka regeneration and spell range formulas again:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $Magicka=2*Intelligence$
	\item $Range=2*Willpower$
	\item $Regeneration=(5+0.1Willpower)\%$ of max magicka per round
\end{itemize}

\section{Spell Properties}

Each spell costs an action to cast in combat and comes with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Effect: What does the spell do?
	\item Target: How the spell's effect is applied (at range, on touch, or on self).
	\item Base Magicka Cost: How much magicka you need to spend to cast this spell.
	\item Magnitude: How big the spell's effect is (e.g. damage dealt, health restored).
	\item Duration: How long the spell's effect lasts.
	\item Area: The radius in which spell effects apply.
	\item School: Which skill is used with the spell.
	\item Skill Level: What skill level is required to cast the spell (Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert or Master).
	\item Action: Does the spell cost an action, or can it be cast as a reaction or bonus action?
\end{itemize}

Note that not all spells have each property. Most spells do not have an area effect but rather act on a single target, for example. Some spells have multiple effects, each with a different duration and sometimes different targeting styles.

Your skill affects the magicka cost of a spell according to the following formula:

$Cost=Base Cost*(1.4-0.012*Skill)$

Outside of battle or other time-critical situations, magicka costs will be ignored because it is assumed you have enough time to regenerate your magicka reserves. If you are ambushed or otherwise threatened immediately after casting a spell outside of battle, the GM may rule that you must deduct the spell cost from your current magicka in the first round. Also, casting outside of combat still requires that you have enough max magicka to cast the spell, and skill requirements still apply.

\subsection{Spell Attacks}

If the target of your spell is unwilling, you will have to make a spell attack roll. Touch spells count as melee attacks, and ranged spells count as ranged attacks; both categories are affected by the bonus and penalty conditions that might normally affect an attack roll. In order to make the attack roll, make sure your target is within range and roll against the skill that governs the spell. If you are successful, the target is hit and the spell takes effect.

If you have a free hand, you may cast another spell of Apprentice level or lower as a bonus action. You must have the magicka to do so, and you must make a spell attack roll if applicable. All the normal rules for spellcasting apply.

Note that spells make noise when cast and so are difficult to use undetected. Journeymen of Illusion may cast any spell silently.

\section{Schools of Magic}

Mainstream culture in Tamriel recognizes six schools of magic, each concerned with different magical effects. Beginning the game with a school of magic as a major skill will grant you starting skills from that school. All classes with magic for at least one major skill begin the game with the following spells in addition to those granted by the schools:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Flare (\textit{11 Magicka, Ranged, Destruction Novice}): The target takes 6 points of fire damage and an additional 1d4 on its next turn.
	\item Heal Minor Wounds (\textit{14 Magicka, Self, Restoration Novice}): You recover 8 health.
\end{itemize}

In combat, casting a spell requires an action unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{Alteration}

The school of Alteration covers spells that manipulate the natural world and its physical properties. Alteration magic allows you to do things like resist physical and elemental attacks, change the weight of items, open locks, and breathe underwater. Some Alteration spells target opponents with negative effects, requiring a spell attack roll.

If Alteration is one of your major skills, you begin the game with the following spells:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open Very Easy Lock (\textit{7 Magicka, Ranged, Novice}): Automatically opens a lock of Very Easy difficulty.
	\item Protect (\textit{10 Magicka, Self, Novice}): +1 to your current armor rating for 5 rounds. You may cast this spell as a bonus action.
\end{itemize}

On an extreme success, Alteration attacks may have greater magnitude or duration.

\newpage
\subsection{Conjuration}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.35\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{conjurer.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

The school of Conjuration is used primarily to summon things from Oblivion. It can be used to conjure daedra and undead as well as summon daedric weapons and armor for very brief periods of time. Summoned creatures will act independently, but are allied with you. They may respond to commands if they are intelligent. You can only have one summoned minion at once. If you conjure a new minion before the current one's time runs out, the current one is dismissed. If you attack your minion, it will become hostile.

If Conjuration is one of your major skills, you begin the game with the following spells:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Summon Skeleton (\textit{45 Magicka, Self, Apprentice}): Summons a Skeleton minion for 7 rounds.
	\item Turn Undead (\textit{11 Magicka, Ranged, Novice}): Undead up to level 3 must use their turn to move as far from you as possible as long as they can see you, and they cannot attack you. This effect lasts until the end of the target's third turn.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Destruction}

The school of Destruction involves all spells that directly harm the body, possessions or abilities. Destruction spells can be used to project flames, ice or lightning as well as break armor, fatigue combatants, and much more. Destruction spells almost always require a spell attack roll.

If Destruction is one of your major skills, you begin the game with the following spells:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cold Touch (\textit{23 Magicka, Touch, Novice}): The target takes 15 points of frost damage and 7 points of stamina damage.
	\item Shocking Touch (\textit{14 Magicka, Touch, Novice}): The target takes 10 points of shock damage and 5 points of magicka damage.
\end{itemize}

On an extreme success, elemental damage spells get a bonus effect. Fire spells set the target on fire, dealing an additional 10\% fire damage over the course of the target's next three turns (damage is taken at the beginning of each turn). Frost spells root the target in place with ice, preventing them from moving on their next turn unless they succeed on a hard Athletics check. Shock spells jump to a nearby target within range, dealing the same effect on the new target.

The following are special abilities you gain access to at certain skill levels (see the mastery perk chart, section 3.2):

Dual Casting: If you have two free hands, you can dual cast any destruction spell. Dual casted spells require double the magicka cost, but they deal triple damage.

Elemental Mastery: Choose an element: fire, frost or lightning. From now on, all spells that deal that damage type gain the corresponding effect:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fire: Enemies under 20\% health are inflicted with fear for 3 turns when struck by a fire spell.
	\item Frost: Enemies under 20\% health are paralyzed for 3 turns when struck by a frost spell.
	\item Lightning: Enemies under 15\% health are immediately turned into ash when struck by a shock spell.
\end{itemize}

You may only choose one element to master, and you choose it once you achieve the mastery perk. The effects of this perk do not take effect on enemies that are resistant to that element, defined as having a resistance greater than 0.

\subsection{Illusion}

Illusion spells manipulate the senses and emotions of their targets. Illusion is useful both in and out of battle with effects such as charms, invisibility, muffling, calming, frenzy and courage. Some illusions will require spell attack rolls. People usually do not like to be tricked with illusions, so using them in social situations will require subterfuge. Illusionists must be clever!

If Illusion is one of your major skills, you begin the game with the following spells:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Soothing Touch (\textit{13 Magicka, Touch, Novice}): Targets up to level 2 are calmed for 2 rounds. Calmed targets will not move or perform any actions. They are aware of your presence, and the effect will end if you attack them.
	\item Starlight (\textit{14 Magicka, Self, Novice}): You emanate bright light in a 20 ft radius and dim light in a 40 ft radius for 1 minute. You may cast this spell as a bonus action.
\end{itemize}

On an extreme success, Illusion attacks may have increased magnitude or duration.

\subsection{Mysticism}

The school of Mysticism is concerned with unraveling the mysteries of the world. Spells under this school are grouped less by categorical membership characteristics and more by tradition, as these spells were considered a single school by the Psijic Order, a group of mages who created them. Effects in this school allow you to detect living creatures, dispel, reflect or absorb magical effects, harvest souls for enchanting, and move distant objects. Some Mysticism spells target opponents and will require attack rolls.

If Mysticism is one of your major skills, you begin the game with the following spells:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minor Dispel (\textit{22 Magicka, Self, Novice}): For all magical effects currently active on you, those that were imposed by a spell that cost no more than 40 magicka are immediately ended. Applies to beneficial and harmful spells alike. Does not apply to magical effects imposed by abilities, diseases, curses, enchantments, potions, poisons or scolls.
	\item Minor Life Detection (\textit{15 Magicka, Self, Novice}): For the next 12 seconds, all living creatures within 60 feet of you appear to give off a faint purple glow that you can see through solid objects. Only you can see this effect.
\end{itemize}

On an extreme success, Mysticism spells may have increased magnitude or duration.

\subsection{Restoration}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{healing.png}
\end{figure}

Restoration magic involves all spells which heal, rest, cure, restore or fortify a target. The effects of Restoration are many and varied, and they include things such as restore health, restore stamina, fortify health, stamina and magicka, fortify skills and attributes, cure poison and diseases and resist magicka. A few Restoration spells can act as attacks, though not many.

If Restoration is one of your major skills, you begin the game with the following spell:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Absorb Health (\textit{12 Magicka, Touch, Novice}): Transfer 5 health from the target to you.
	\item Minor Healing Hands (\textit{32 Magicka, Touch, Apprentice}): Heals the target for 15 health.
\end{itemize}

On an extreme success, Restoration spells may have increased magnitude or duration.

\section{Learning New Spells}

In the Elder Scrolls, there is no limit on how many spells you can know. You can learn new spells by finding spell vendors in towns or in Mages Guild buildings, reading spell tomes, or even crafting your own spells if you can gain access to a rare spellmaking altar.

\subsection{Spellmaking}

If you have access to a spellmaking altar, you can make your own spells. Such altars are exceedingly rare; for example, the only spellmaking altars in Cyrodiil are found at the Arcane University of the Imperial City, which can only be accessed by Mages Guild affiliates who have undergone a certain level of training. Once you have acquired access, however, use the following rules to create a spell:

\begin{itemize}
	\item You get to choose the spell's name.
	\item To give the spell a certain effect, you must already know a spell with that effect. This includes race and birthsign powers.
	\item Multiple effects may be added to a single spell.
	\item For each effect, you choose the targeting type, magnitude, duration and area.
	\item Calculate the magicka cost using the following formula: $Total Cost=0.1Base Cost*0.15Area*Duration*Magnitude^{1.28}$
\end{itemize}

If the spell is ranged, multiply the result by 1.5 to get the final base cost. Duration is in rounds. Ask your GM for information on the base costs of effects or use the following link: \url{http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Spell_Effects}

Once you have these things determined, you must perform a 2-hour ritual to create the spell. The materials for the ritual cost a total of three times the magicka cost of the spell.

\chapter{Crafting}

The Elder Scrolls franchise has featured a number of different crafting systems that allowed you to create weapons, armor, potions, poisons, spells, and enchantments. This chapter is dedicated to describing the crafting systems of the Elder Scrolls Tabletop RPG: Alchemy, Blacksmithing and Enchanting. These all require some calculation, so be sure to have those calculators handy! Fortunately, you will not be doing them often. (Spellmaking is covered in Chapter 6. See section 6.4.1. for details.)

\section{Alchemy}

(Please note: Alchemy is indisputably the most calculation-intensive crafting skill thanks to Bethesda's convoluted system! I have simplified it somewhat, but it still requires you to pay careful attention every time you craft a potion! You've been warned!)

Alchemy is the art of making potions and poisons. Many substances have latent magical properties that only come out when properly distilled. To create alchemical concoctions, you need a mortar and pestle and at least two ingredients to mix together. You can mix up to four ingredients at once. If two of the ingredients share a property, the resulting mixture will have that property as well. Using more than two ingredients with the same effect will not increase the magnitude or duration of that effect, however; these are determined by skill level and the alchemy equipment you use.

This method can be used to discover the properties possessed by the reagents you use. You can also eat a small portion of a single ingredient to learn that ingredient's most prominent properties. This is called \textit{wortcraft}. As your Alchemy skill improves, your wortcraft will allow you to detect more properties from individual reagents. You may also learn some alchemical properties from recipes or books. Seek out your local alchemist for more information. It is recommended you keep an alchemy notebook detailing the known properties of reagents.

\subsection{Potion or Poison?}

In the Elder Scrolls series, some factor determines whether your alchemical concoction qualifies as a potion or a poison, which affects whether you drink it or apply it to your weapon when used. The factor varies by game. In the Elder Scrolls Tabletop, there is no hard difference between potions and poisons. In fact, any concoction can be drunk or applied to a weapon if you wish. You could drink a Damage Health poison or apply a Restore Health potion to an arrow if you really wanted to.

\subsection{Alchemy Apparatuses}

While the mortar and pestle is the only alchemy apparatus you need to craft a potion, there are other types of apparatuses you can use to improve upon its effects. Each type comes in five quality levels, the use of which is restricted by current Alchemy level: Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert and Master. Each quality level has a value used in the alchemy equations. The following values apply to each apparatus:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Novice: 0.1
	\item Apprentice: 0.25
	\item Journeyman: 0.5
	\item Expert: 0.75
	\item Master: 1
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Mortar and Pestle}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.2\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mortarpestle.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

This apparatus consists of a hard bowl made of stone, ceramic or hard wood (the mortar) and a heavy, blunt, club-shaped object (the pestle). Reagents are placed into the mortar and then ground into a fine mixture which is then stirred into water to create a potion. The mortar and pestle are required to craft any potion or poison.

The magnitude and duration of each effect of mixtures produced using only a mortar and pestle are called the \textit{base magnitude} and \textit{base duration}. These are used as intermediate values when other apparatuses are involved; otherwise, they are the true magnitude and duration of the mixture. Base magnitude and duration are calculated with the following formulas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $Base Magnitude=(\frac{Alchemy Skill+25MortarPestleQuality}{0.4EffectBaseCost})^{1/2.28}$
	\item $Base Duration=4*Base Magnitude$
\end{itemize}

Certain potion effects do not come with a magnitude, such as water breathing. Dispel effects likewise do not come with a duration. For these special cases, use the following formulas instead:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $Base Magnitude=(\frac{Alchemy Skill+MortarPestleQuality*25}{0.1EffectBaseCost})^{1/1.28}$
	\item $Base Duration=\frac{Alchemy Skill+MortarPestleQuality*25}{0.1EffectBaseCost}$
\end{itemize}

(Author note: I am not sure whether the exponent difference is a typo or not. If your potion magnitude seems off, try using the other exponent and see if it makes more sense. Let me know if this comes up in game.)

The value \textit{MortarPestleQuality} is taken from the list in the previous subsection. The value used for \textit{Effect Base Cost} comes from which types of effects the potion will have. Ask your GM for the value needed or consult the following link: \url{http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Spell_Effects}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Retort}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.2\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{retort.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

A retort is a roughly spherical vessel with a long, downward-pointing neck. It is typically made of glass, though it may also be made of metal. Retorts are used to distill liquids by allowing vapors to condense in the neck, after which they flow downward into a collection vessel placed underneath.

If you use a retort in your concoction, it will increase the magnitude and duration of all positive effects. Magnitudes are increased by $50\%*Quality$. Durations are increased by $100\%*Quality$.

\subsubsection{Calcinator}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.2\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{calcinator.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

A calcinator is a metal bowl on a ring stand. An alchemical mixture is placed into it above an open flame, heating it to temperatures at which some compounds in the mixture decompose or transition into other forms.

Using a calcinator in your concoction will increase the magnitude and duration of both positive and negative effects. The magnitude and duration of positive effects are increased by $35\%*Quality$, and the magnitude and duration of negative effects are increased by $140\%*Quality$.

\subsubsection{Alembic}

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.3\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{alembic.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

An alembic consists of two glass vessels joined by a downward-sloping tube. The mixture is heated in one vessel, producing vapors which collect at the top of the tube and flow into the collection vessel. The only difference between this and a retort is that the retort has the tube joined with the top of the heated vessel, suggesting the game developers did not think thoroughly about their choice of alchemy apparatuses. In fact, retorts are often part of an alembic.

Regardless, using an alembic will increase the magnitude and duration of your mixture's negative effects. Magnitudes are increased by $50\%*Quality$. Durations are increased by $100\%*Quality$.

\subsubsection{Using Multiple Apparatuses}
When you use multiple apparatuses in a potion, the modifying percentages are added before being applied to the base magnitude and duration. For example, a positive effect will increase by 240\% when a master retort and calcinator are used.

\subsubsection{Selling Potions}
Potions are often a great way of making money. The base cost for each potion you make is equal to $0.45(Alchemy Skill*25MortarPestleQuality)$.

\section{Blacksmithing}

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was the first entry in the franchise to introduce a crafting system for weapons and armor. In previous titles, the Armorer skill was only used to repair items. Since the Elder Scrolls Tabletop is primarily based on the mechanics of Morrowind and Oblivion, the blacksmithing system is made from scratch to provide a simple, sensible way to create weapons and armor.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{blacksmith.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Requirements}
Unlike in Skyrim, the Elder Scrolls Tabletop does not require that you collect a set of components necessary to craft an item. Rather, the GM will specify a gold cost for crafting the item which is assumed to cover the expenses of acquiring the components. Blacksmithing can be very expensive!

Certain narrative conditions may be required before you can craft an item. Does your character have the knowledge needed to smith with a certain material or in a certain style? Are you able to find or purchase all the materials you need, or are some items completely unavailable? Sometimes, narrative conditions can reduce the cost of crafting an item as well. For example, if you collected a lot of Dwemer metal while exploring a Dwemer ruin, crafting Dwemer metal items should not cost as much. Work with your GM to decide the conditions affecting your ability to create items.

When you have met all conditions, you need access to a forge and enough time to work. Don't expect to craft items in a dungeon.

\section{Enchanting}

Enchanting is the art of applying persistent magical effects to items. Enchanted items are highly sought after by most cultures in Tamriel for a multitude of reasons. For example, their effects are constant and do not drain magicka when used, they can be used by people without magical training and they are immune to dispel effects. Weapons with enchantments have a limited number of charges, though they may be recharged by spell merchants or by using filled soul gems. Enchanted weapons also gain the Magic property, even when their enchantment charges are depleted. Beware, however: blacksmiths cannot repair enchanted items unless their Armorer skill is Journeyman level or higher.

\subsection{Requirements}
To begin enchanting, you must first gain access to an enchanting altar. These are significantly more common than spellmaking altars and may be found in places such as Mages Guild buildings or wizards' homes. Once you have access to an enchanting altar, you need a soul gem with a trapped soul and an item to receive the enchantment. You may place any magical effect on the item if it is the effect of a spell you know and can cast. You also get to name the item. Certain spell effects cannot be used as enchantments. For example, worn items cannot be enchanted with healing effects. Spell effects may be denied for enchantment at the GM's discretion.

With all these things, you may perform a one-hour ritual to carry out the enchantment. Various other components are needed, the cost of which is equal to the base effect cost (ask your GM or see \url{http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Spell_Effects}) times the magnitude of the effect. Only one effect can be placed on an item at a time. If you perform the enchantment ritual on an item that is already enchanted, its enchantment is overwritten by the new one. The base value of an enchanted item increases by the magnitude of the effect multiplied by the effect's barter factor (see \url{http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Spell_Effects}).

\subsection{Soul Gems}

Soul gems are special magic crystals that can be used to capture the souls of living creatures when they die. Once filled, they can be used to apply enchantments or recharge enchanted items. Soul gems come in six quality levels:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Petty
	\item Lesser
	\item Common
	\item Greater
	\item Grand
	\item Black
\end{itemize}

Creature souls come in five sizes that correspond with soul gem types: Petty, Lesser, Common, Greater and Grand. A soul gem can hold souls of equal or lesser size. The souls of intelligent creatures (humanoids and the like) always count as Grand, but they may only be stored in black soul gems. This practice is illegal and is considered a form of necromancy. Nevertheless, it is possible.

\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.37\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{soulgem.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

Capturing a soul is quite simple: if the target dies while affected by a Soul Trap effect and you have a soul gem capable of holding its soul, you may choose to fill the soul gem with it. Soul Trap effects can be applied by spells or even enchanted weapons.

When a soul gem is used for enchanting or recharging, the crystal breaks and cannot be reused. A soul gem with a soul inside cannot contain another soul, nor can the trapped soul be discarded and replaced.

\subsection{Weapon Enchantments}
Weapon enchantments have a certain amount of magicka stored in them and expend a certain amount of magicka each time they are used. The amount of magicka spent is determined by the spell cost formula described in section 6.4.1; it depends on magnitude and effect. You get to choose the magnitude of the enchantment you place on a weapon so long as the resulting cost does not exceed 85. The maximum amount of magicka stored in a weapon enchantment is determined by the level of the soul used to enchant the item. The magicka value of each soul level is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Petty: 150 magicka
	\item Lesser: 300 magicka
	\item Common: 800 magicka
	\item Greater: 1200 magicka
	\item Grand: 1600 magicka
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the number of uses is determined by the charge of the item divided by the magicka cost of the effect. A maximum magnitude enchantment made with a grand soul would therefore have 18 charges, for example. 

Whenever you use a soul to recharge an item, it regains magicka equal to the size of the soul used. For example, a weapon with a charge of 1000/1600 that is recharged with a petty soul will end up with 1150/1600 magicka.

\subsection{Worn Enchantments}
Enchantments can also be placed on clothing, jewelry and armor. Worn enchantments do not expend charge but rather have a constant effect that is always active so long as you are wearing the item. The effect magnitude of worn item enchantments cannot be chosen, but is rather a product of the soul level used to create it. To determine the magnitude of the enchantment, ask your GM or consult the table at \url{http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Enchanting#Worn_Enchantments}.

\chapter{Adventuring and Downtime}
This chapter covers rules about adventuring and what goes on between adventures.

\section{Leveling Up}
When your GM decides you have enough experience and you have time to rest, you main gain a level. You get the following benefits:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Your max health increases by 10\% of your Endurance.
	\item You may distribute 10 points among your major skills, but no more than 5 into any single one.
	\item You may distribute 10 points among your minor skills, but no more than 3 into any single one.
	\item Once your skill points are distributed, select three primary attributes to increase. This is where the governing attributes of skills come in: if you have not raised any skills governed by an attribute, a selected attribute will increase by only one point. If you have put 1-4 points into skills governed by that attribute, it increases by 2 points. If you have put 5-7 points in skills governed by that attribute, it increases by 3 points. If you have put 8-9 points in skills governed by that attribute, it increases by 4 points. Finally, if you have put 10 or more points into skills governed by an attribute, it increases by 5 points.
\end{itemize}

Example: Ingvar Iron-Fist the Nord Barbarian increases his level from 1 to 2. His Endurance is 55, so his max health increases by 5 points. He puts 4 skill points into Blunt, 2 into Athletics and 4 into Light Armor for his major skills. For his minors, he puts 3 into Acrobatics, 3 into Sneak, 3 into Marksman and 1 into Speechcraft. He selects the attributes Strength, Speed and Endurance to increase. He has put 4 points into Strength skills, so his Strength goes up by 2 points. He has put 10 points into Speed skills, so his Speed goes up by 5. He has put no points into Endurance skills, so his Endurance goes up by 1.

\section{Encumbrance}
You are able to carry a weight equal to $5*Strength$ in pounds. If you exceed this weight, you are encumbered and cannot move. Mounts do not have this limitation, but don't get crazy. There are also spells which can alter encumbrance limits.

\section{Travel}
Characters can travel 24 miles per day, assuming they are traveling for a full 8 hours. Each additional hour of travel after that risks exhaustion. Make a percentile roll at the end of each additional hour. You must roll less than or equal to $50-5*extra hours$ or increase your exhaustion level.

Mounts are able to move double speed for one hour, but they must rest an hour before they can do so again. Vehicles are limited by specific speeds, but they may be able to travel for over 8 hours a day without penalty.

Difficult terrain halves travel speed while it is traversed.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Morrowind.png}
\end{figure}

\section{Resting}
A short rest is defined by a period of at least an hour during which time you do nothing more strenuous than eat, drink, tend to wounds or other physically restful tasks. Your health, magicka and stamina are fully recovered after short rest, though you may not decrease your level of exhaustion. If you have enough experience, you may gain a level during this time.

A long rest is a period spanning at least 8 hours of sleep and light activity including no more than 2 hours of standing watch. You gain all the benefits of a short rest and may decrease your exhaustion by one level. You must complete a long rest once per day with access to sufficient food and drink or else your exhaustion will increase a level.

\section{Survival}
Survival in the Elder Scrolls Tabletop relies on a combination of roleplaying and skill checks. There are no "Surivival" skills like there are in other RPGs; rather, the effects of what you do will be decided by which actions you take and what skills you character possesses. Alchemy, for example, may be useful to determine whether plants are safe for eating. Sneak may be useful to hunt for food. Acrobatics could be useful to get to a vantage point and find running water. Improvise, and wilderness survival will still be a fun challenge.

\subsection{Food}
A grown humanoid needs a pound of food a day to survive. Eating half a pound of food in a day will count as a half-day without food. You can go without food for a number of days equal to $3+0.05Endurance$. After this point, each full day you go without food will increase your exhaustion by one level. A normal day of eating resets the count.

\subsection{Water}
A character needs a gallon of water a day, or two if the weather is hot and dry. Characters who only drink half that in a day must roll less than or equal to $75-0.05Endurance$ or suffer a level of exhaustion. Characters who get even less gain an exhaustion level automatically. If the character already has at least one exhaustion level, they gain two exhaustion levels due to lack of water.

\section{Vision}
Most tasks require vision to some extent. \textit{Lightly obscured} areas provide a bonus die to Sneak checks. \textit{Heavily obscured areas} obstruct vision entirely imposing blindness on everyone in them. Certain weather conditions may obscure vision. Bright light does not obscure, dim light obscures lightly, and darkness obscured heavily. Vision-altering effects may change how light levels affect your character.

\section{Lockpicking}
Picking locks depends on your Security skill. As long as you have a lockpick, you can attempt to pick a lock. You can automatically pick locks at your skill level as defined in the mastery perk chart. You may attempt to pick higher level locks, but you must roll to succeed. If the lock is one level higher than your automatic success level, you need a normal success. If the lock is two levels higher, you need a hard success. If the lock is three levels higher, you need an extreme success. If the lock is four levels higher, it is impossible.

\section{Traps}
You're likely to encounter traps whenever you venture into a dungeon. Detecting traps works using two skills: Sneak and Security. Having a high Sneak skill allows you to set well-hidden traps since you know a lot about hiding things from sight. Security is used to detect the presence of traps and successfully disarm them. Thus, attempting to set traps for other characters will rely on your Sneak and attempting to detect traps before you run into them will depend on your Security.

\section{Different Types of Movement}

\subsection{Climbing and Swimming}
While climbing or swimming, each foot moved costs an extra foot of your movement (or an extra 2 feet in difficult terrain). If conditions are especially hostile, you may be required to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check.

\subsection{Jumping}
If you have at least 10 feet to get a running start, you can long jump a distance in feet equal to one-fifth of your Acrobatics or Strength, whichever is higher. Standing long jumps can only cover half that distance. Each foot you clear costs a foot of movement. You may be required to make an Acrobatics check to jump farther than you normally can.

If you have at least 10 feet to get a running start, you can high jump a height in feet equal to 3+5\% of your Acrobatics or Strength, whichever is higher. Standing high jumps can only jump half as high. You may be required to make an Acrobatics check to jump higher than you normally can. You can extend you arms to reach higher while jumping.

\subsection{Falling}
Gravity exists in the world of Elder Scrolls, and you will get hurt if you fall down. Experienced acrobats are able to handle falls better than the average person, however. For every 10 feet you fall, you suffer 4d20 health damage, ignoring armor. For every 25 points in your Acrobatics skill, this distance increases by 5 feet.

\section{Social Interaction}
Your Personality attribute along with various factors will set an NPC's initial disposition toward you. Rather than rolling Speechcraft to determine whether an NPC is convinced of specific things, Speechcraft checks allow you to increase your disposition with an NPC by varying amounts depending on your level of success. The resulting disposition level may be high enough that the NPC is willing to give you something you ask for, depending on what it is.

The limits on Speechcraft checks depend on your roleplaying: you may not attempt a roll for the same oratory tactic twice in the same conversation. You also cannot make more than three Speechcraft checks to improve disposition in a single conversation, meaning you must take time to build up a positive rapport with an NPC unless you are very skilled or lucky. Speechcraft mastery perks improve your ability to do this.

NPC disposition may be affected by circumstance. If you cannot improve disposition well enough in a single conversation, you might try doing something that the NPC will like. Gifts of money or valuable items will help as well, but be sure to give a gift appropriate to the NPC's wealth and station, or else they may find it insulting!

\section{Downtime}

\subsection{Lifestyle Expenses}
Between adventures, you need to pay the expenses demanded by your lifestyle. It is up to you what sort of lifestyle you wish to live, so long as you can afford it. This has no mechanical effect, but it may change how NPCs are disposed to react to you. The local nobility might give you more attention if you are known to live a wealthy lifestyle. Lifestyle costs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Wretched (Inhumane): 0 Septims/day
	\item Squalid (Basic shelter): 10 Septims/day
	\item Poor (Sufficient but unpredictable): 25 Septims/day
	\item Modest (Stable home): 100 Septims/day
	\item Comfortable (Middle-class): 200 Septims/day
	\item Wealthy (Good businessman): 500 Septims/day
	\item Aristocratic (Old money): At least 1000 Septims/day
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work}
If you are working a profession, it is assumed you earn and spend money on lifestyle expenses to support a modest living. If you are affiliated with an organization that can provide gainful employment (e.g. Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, Thieves Guild or another such thing), you can support a comfortable lifestyle. If you have a high skill in Mercantile, you can support a wealthy lifestyle.

\section{Research}
In the Elder Scrolls tabletop, there are no knowledge skills to determine whether your character knows something already. Instead, the GM will give you any information your character should reasonably know based on backstory information, and new information will be learned from NPCs and interacting with the world. Sometimes, you may be called upon to do in-depth research taking several days. If your character is capable of performing this research and has the time, you may do so. Otherwise, it is best to enlist the services of a scholar and then wait.

\section{Disease}
During your adventure, you may be unfortunate enough to contract a disease. Diseases inflict various penalties to your stats and may render you unable to work during downtime. There are three methods of recover: potions, altars and rest. Ingesting a disease cure potion or praying at an altar of the Divines will immediately cure most diseases, leading many afflicted to seek out alchemists and priests. Those who cannot access either may roll percentile against $25+0.05Endurance$ every three days of rest to end the disease.

\section{Conditions}
Conditions alter your abilities in certain ways. They can arise as a result of combat techniques, spells or natural laws.

\subsection{Blinded}
A blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails and sight-based check. Attack rolls against a blinded creature have a bonus die, and attack rolls made by the creature have a penalty die.

\subsection{Calmed}
A calmed creature has no strong emotions and will not attack anyone or move. Calmed creatures are still aware, and being attacked will end their calm state.

\subsection{Charmed}
A charmed creature will not take action against the charmer. The charmer has a bonus die on Speechcraft checks with the creature for the duration.

\subsection{Deafened}
A deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any hearing-based check. Everyone is deafened to the movements of a Muffled creature.

\subsection{Exhausted}
Exhaustion comes in multiple levels. Each level includes all the penalties of the levels prior to it. Finishing a long rest makes your exhaustion level go down by 1, assuming you have access to sufficient food and drink.

Levels of exhaustion:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 1. Penalty die on all skill rolls.
	\item 2. Movement halved.
	\item 3. Penalty die on all attack and reaction rolls.
	\item 4. Max health halved.
	\item 5. Movement is 0.
	\item 6. Death.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frenzied}
A frenzied creature is blinded by consuming rage and cannot think clearly or distinguish friend from foe. It will attack the nearest creature it can, indiscriminately.

\subsection{Frightened}
A frightened creature has a penalty die on all attack and skill rolls made while its source of fear is within sight and cannot willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

\subsection{Grappled}
A grappled creature has no movement.

\subsection{Incapacitated}
An incapacitated creature cannot move, use actions or reactions.

\subsection{Invisible}
The creature is impossible to see without magic or special tactics. While invisible, a creature is considered heavily obscured and has a bonus die on attack rolls while attack rolls made against it have a penalty die.

\subsection{Paralyzed}
A paralyzed creature is incapacitated and cannot move or speak. Attacks against a paralyzed creature get a bonus die, and any attacks made within 5 feet are automatically critical hits.

\subsection{Poisoned}
A poisoned creature takes a penalty die to attack and skill rolls.

\subsection{Prone}
The creature can only move by crawling, unless it stands up. It takes a penalty die to attacks it makes, and attacks made against it get a bonus die if the attacker is within 5 feet. Otherwise, attacks made against it get a penalty die.

\subsection{Recoiled (AKA Staggered)}
The creature is momentarily set off balance and must use its next action to recover. A recoiled creature will gain increased resistance to recoil briefly after regaining balance.

\subsection{Unconscious}
As with Paralyzed, but the creature also drops what it is holding, falls prone, and recovers stamina at a rate of 60/round. If the unconsciousness is induced by stamina loss, the creature regains consciousness when its stamina is non-negative.

\chapter*{Afterword}
This concludes the Elder Scrolls Tabletop Role Playing Game Player's Handbook. Once again, Elder Scrolls and all its titles and properties belong to Bethesda Game Studios.
